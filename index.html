        <strong>This is my first dive into WebDev!</strong>
        <p>Lets <strong>create</strong> something!</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            I need to learn how to do WedDev before the end of this year at the latest and 
            at the earliest by something like September!
        </p>

        <h3>Why do I need to learn WebDev?</h3>
            <p>
                Because <strong>MONEY</strong> thats why.
            </p>

            <p>
                I need to start <em>making more money</em> as soon as possible!
            </p>
